The AnsiC stack needs special configuration for the LDS project.
in opcua_config.h, the following defines need these values:

	OPCUA_MULTITHREADED                        OPCUA_CONFIG_NO
	OPCUA_USE_SYNCHRONISATION                  OPCUA_CONFIG_NO

Before building the LDS the stack respective open ssl need to be already compuled for the desred target.
For details on how to build the stack please reffer to the ANSI C Stack readmme file.
